# Python_Diwali_Sales_Analysis
In this project, we analyze Diwali sales data using Python libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. The goal is to gain insights into customer behavior, product sales trends, and identify factors that contribute to sales performance during the Diwali season.

Data Loading and Preprocessing: Use Pandas to load the dataset, clean missing or incorrect data, and format columns for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Generate summary statistics using NumPy and Pandas to understand key metrics like total sales, average order value, and customer demographics.
Visualization:
Use Seaborn and Matplotlib to create visualizations such as:
Sales distribution by product categories, states, and cities.
Customer segmentation based on age, gender, and spending.
Time-series analysis of sales during the Diwali period.
Insights & Trends: Identify top-selling products, high-value customer segments, and periods of peak sales activity to help businesses target marketing strategies more effectively.
This project provides data-driven insights to optimize future Diwali sales strategies.
